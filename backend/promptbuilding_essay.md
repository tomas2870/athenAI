# Example transcript and essay
"
Question: Tell me about yourself.

Answer: Hi, I'm Alex, a high school junior. I'm passionate about computer science and enjoy coding in Python. I’m also involved in my school's robotics team.

Question: What are your academic goals after high school?

Answer: I want to major in computer science, focusing on AI and machine learning. I'm aiming to get into a top-tier university and eventually work at a tech company like Google or start my own tech business.

Question: What subjects are you currently struggling with, if any?

Answer: Math is a bit challenging for me, especially calculus, but I’m working on improving with the help of online resources and a tutor.

Question: Do you participate in any extracurricular activities?

Answer: Yes, I'm part of the robotics team, and I also play soccer. I like how robotics allows me to apply what I learn in class, and soccer helps me stay active and work as part of a team.

Question: Have you thought about any specific colleges you'd like to apply to?

Answer: Yes, I’m looking at schools like MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon because of their strong computer science programs and innovation-driven culture.

Question: What direction do you want to go with your college essay?

Answer: I want to write about my experience leading the robotics team and how it taught me problem-solving and leadership skills, but I'm also thinking about discussing how I’ve used coding to help local businesses automate their processes.

Question: What are you struggling with in your essay right now?

Answer: I'm struggling with making my essay sound unique. I feel like a lot of people have similar experiences with leadership and tech, so I’m not sure how to make mine stand out.

Question: What do you think is the biggest challenge you'll face during the college application process?

Answer: The biggest challenge for me will be writing strong essays and standing out from other applicants, especially since so many students are good at coding now.

Question: How do you plan to make your application stand out?

Answer: I’m planning to showcase my leadership skills from robotics, as well as a machine learning project I’ve been working on. I’m also trying to develop a strong personal statement that highlights my passion for solving real-world problems through technology.

Question: What specific incident or project on your robotics team challenged you to use leadership and technical skills in a way that uniquely reflects your personal growth or problem-solving approach?

Answer: One of the most challenging projects I worked on was designing an autonomous robot for a competition. Our team was behind schedule because we couldn’t get the sensors to work properly, and the team was getting frustrated. As the team lead, I had to step up and figure out how to keep everyone motivated while also diving into the technical problem. I spent a weekend debugging the sensor code, and once I had a better understanding, I explained the issue to the rest of the team in a way that was easy to understand. This not only helped us fix the issue but also boosted the team's morale. That experience taught me the importance of clear communication in leadership, as well as how critical it is to stay calm and focused when faced with technical challenges. It was a turning point for me, both in terms of my leadership style and how I approach complex problems.

## USER
prompt: "Why NYU?"

essay: "When I think about my future in computer science, I envision myself working at the intersection of technology and society. I want to not only develop innovative AI systems but also apply them to solve real-world challenges in urban environments. New York University, with its unique combination of academic rigor, urban location, and interdisciplinary focus, stands out to me as the ideal place to pursue these ambitions.
One of the key reasons I’m drawn to NYU is its renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which has an outstanding reputation in computer science, especially in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These fields are my passion, and I’m eager to learn from faculty members who are at the forefront of AI research. Access to this level of expertise, combined with NYU’s interdisciplinary programs, will give me the tools to explore the deeper societal implications of technology, something I find increasingly important.
What excites me even more about NYU is the way it integrates its academic offerings with the city of New York. NYU’s location provides a living laboratory for applying technology to solve urban challenges. I want to work on projects that address problems like improving public transportation systems or optimizing resource distribution in densely populated areas. NYU’s commitment to research and collaboration with New York City’s institutions would give me the opportunity to make an immediate impact on my surroundings. Being in such a vibrant, global city means I’ll have the chance to interact with and learn from people with diverse perspectives, which I believe is essential for personal and professional growth.
Additionally, NYU’s emphasis on global education resonates with me. I’m interested in exploring the ways technology can be used to bridge cultural and economic divides, and NYU’s global network, with campuses in cities like Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, would allow me to expand my understanding of how technology impacts different societies. Having the opportunity to study abroad while still benefiting from the same high level of education is something I find invaluable.
Lastly, NYU’s culture of creativity and innovation aligns with my own approach to learning. Whether I’m working on autonomous robots with my high school’s robotics team or developing machine learning models, I constantly look for new ways to approach challenges. NYU’s interdisciplinary ethos and encouragement of exploration in different fields, from the arts to business to technology, will allow me to continue expanding my horizons. I’m eager to collaborate with students from different disciplines to build projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
In summary, NYU offers the perfect combination of academic excellence, real-world application, and global perspective that I’m looking for in a university. I’m confident that being a part of the NYU community will not only help me grow as a computer scientist but also as a leader who can leverage technology to improve the world around me."
