An octopus, three chickens, a bevy of clams, and 15 [LOCAL ORGANIZATION]  volunteers gathered together on a clam farm. What would unite this ragtag bunch of marine avengers? The [LOCAL ORGANIZATION].
As a board member of [LOCAL ORGANIZATION], I helped to arrange the sorting and scattering of over 76,000 live clams into [LOCAL TOWN]  to analyze our clam population. Because 7,000 pounds of clams are not just weighed, wrapped, and handed over by the fishmonger, my cohorts and I sorted through a hundred thousand clams by hand. Live clams went into a bucket; dead clams and other unlucky marine dwellers were fed to the chickens. After I sorted through a relentless cascade of mollusks falling from the clam tumbler, we loaded the bivalves and headed to [LOCAL TOWN] to drop them. Scientists will study the clams over the coming years.
Additional clam drops are scheduled.
