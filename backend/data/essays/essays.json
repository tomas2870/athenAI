My dad promptly hailed an iconic yellow-top, black-bottom cab, and we were suddenly snaking through [CITY] sunbathed white skyscrapers, just offset from the glistening [NAME OF SEA].\n\u201cMom, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d a six-year-old me exclaimed.\nMom pulled out the last packet of Parle-G cookies and handed them to me. Tearing the packet up and placing a cookie in my mouth, I relished the crunch and sweet sugar crumbs as they melted on my tongue. Suddenly, we hit traffic. A bull was crossing the road, and while the cars made way for this holy animal to pass, the homeless of [CITY] found this an opportune moment to solicit donations from the drivers. As we sat parked on the road, a girl my age knocked on the car window.\n\u201c[PHRASE IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE]\u201d, she pleaded in [LANGUAGE].\nMy mom immediately grabbed the Parle-Gs out of my hand and gave them to the girl. The girl quietly thanked her and left. Sad to see my beloved cookies go, I quietly looked out the window at the street and the seashore. But my eyes were curiously drawn to the homeless lying on the side of the road, persistently requesting a morsel of food from passersby. I started to wonder what caused these people to live the way they did. In the best way I could articulate it, I turned to my mom to ask her what I felt was a simple question.\n\u201cMom, why are some people poor?\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d she responded, thinking. \u201cBecause no one wants to give them a job\u201d.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I pressed further.\n\u201cBecause there was no opportunity for them to go to school\u201d, she quickly replied.\nI sank back down in my seat. \u201cSo the girl who knocked on our window doesn\u2019t go to school? That\u2019s weird. Isn\u2019t every kid supposed to go to school?\u201d, I wondered. Given recent geopolitical events barring Afghan women from receiving an education, I\u2019ve been reminded (with a chill) of this moment from my childhood. \nI find it unacceptable that even after a decade of progress in multifarious fields, every child still isn\u2019t guaranteed an education and the opportunity to pursue a prosperous future. As I\u2019ve witnessed the vast and virtually ubiquitous accessibility that the internet - through Zoom, Khan Academy, and even YouTube - has brought to the realm of education, I believe we have a greater responsibility today to not let children in even the most remote of places and with even the most disadvantaged of backgrounds go uneducated. The main obstacle standing in our way to achieving this is the political will to do so, but with the right degree of leverage (and the right degree), that could all change in historic fashion! Pursuing an undergraduate degree to help build a stable foundation in the world of international relations, I aim to work with leaders both at home and abroad to ensure that every child has the same educational and career-oriented opportunities, regardless of origin or socio-economic background. By this point, I\u2019ve gone all-in on my own education, but now - with eyes as wide open as my heart - I\u2019m ready to take my impact to the next level and go all-in on education-for-all."

When you first stand at the bottom and look at those that are already at the top, the destination becomes enticing. Each sport is a different staircase, and once you pick which staircase you want to take, the real journey begins. The first few steps are easy: joining a team, making friends, and just having fun. As you begin to climb, it seems so simple and you ask yourself, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t everyone want to climb this staircase?\u201d But soon but your ignorance will fade and you will realize why some choose to stay on the ground level. \nThe longer and higher you climb, the more serious you get about making it to the top. The pressure of reaching the final destination can feel overwhelming at times, but you keep climbing because after starting this journey, you become determined to finish it. For some, this is not the case. They look down at the bottom of the staircase and decide that giving up on all of the steps that they have spent so much time climbing is a better option than continuing to climb a staircase that they don\u2019t even want to be on anymore. For those who keep climbing, they trip and they fall, maybe sometimes even going down a few steps. When they take a break, it feels as if they are going to fall behind, and that everyone else is going to beat them to the top. \nAlthough the staircase is being portrayed to seem like a constant struggle, those who truly want to be on it fall in love with the process of climbing. There is no better feeling than looking down and seeing how far you have come compared to where you started. Reaching certain floors on the way to the top is one of the best and most validating feelings there is, especially when you are reaching those floors with people who you would do anything for. In a way, the staircase is never-ending. Once you make it to the top, you can always go back down and help those who have just started the climb. If there is one thing that the staircase of sports will teach you, it\u2019s that no matter how hard the climbing felt, every step was completely worth it."

Because of that, my postgraduate plans begin with pursuing entrepreneurship and education reform, then shifting to law and public policy.\nIn my early career, organically scaling [COMPANY] will likely be how I make the greatest impact, as startups enable widespread outreach and freedom regardless of age. Furthermore, making financial literacy more accessible is key to millions of Americans breaking out of debt or into financial freedom, and though startups are always at risk of failing, nothing great comes easy or riskless. In my junior year of college, I\u2019d like to apply for Harvard Law school\u2019s Junior Deferral Program (JDP). The JDP Program will allow me to spend 2 or more years pursuing my entrepreneurship propensity (by scaling [COMPANY] full-time) and allow me to spend time in the real world before law school, further enriching my law school experience.\nOnce [COMPANY] attains at least a million users to measurably help overcome our country's limitations regarding financial literacy, I'd turn my attention from the bank boardroom to the Supreme Courtroom and attempt to address our nation's most poignant public policy issues, such as a lack of gun control, providing accessible health care, and funding the public education system. To do so, I\u2019d attend law school (preferably, Harvard Law School) and specialize in public interest law, pursuing my proclivity for making resources more accessible and equitable. The same way [COMPANY] aims to make financial literacy more accessible to everyday Americans, I\u2019d make the legal system more accessible to everyday Americans. Using my entrepreneurial skills, I seek to found a civil rights law firm with a mission to represent the underrepresented: those who are the most in need. After practicing civil rights law, it is, always has been, and always will be my mission to run for state public office, and then for national office. In the same way that I served as Class President and led my school district\u2019s leadership council to advocate for a successful change in our district\u2019s GPA system, I\u2019d be both honored and humbled to serve our country and create greater positive change in our nation because serving others is the one thing that makes me happiest.\nEntrepreneurship, education reform, and policymaking are my clear callings; allied with my mission to help those most in need, I\u2019d like to make financial education accessible to all by scaling [COMPANY], pursuing civil rights law, being elected to public office, and passing much-needed legislation to improve equity nationally and possibly even, with a robust enough platform like that of Harvard, globally. And although global impact may still be a ways away for me, an essential modus operandi that has helped me persevere when the road ahead seems overwhelming is to \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d, which crystallizes both my career goals as a prospective public servant and my very reasons for seeking transfer."

I\u2019ll be taking notes not just to excel in the class, but to craft my own public image as a public servant moving forward! Because all Government concentrators are allowed to meet 2 of their elective requirements through courses at the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), I\u2019d be elated to cross-enroll in HKS. Specifically, I\u2019ve read Professor Roger Porter\u2019s book Presidential Decision Making and would be thrilled to take Professor Porter\u2019s class \u201cThe Business-Government Relationship in the United States\u201d as an entrepreneur and aspiring political candidate. To further deepen my understanding of public policy, I\u2019d join the Institute of Politics' Policy Program, a Harvard undergraduate-run think tank to develop my skills in policy research.\nThough I\u2019m less certain of which year - sophomore, junior, or senior - I\u2019ll do the following, I\u2019m excited to cross-enroll in HKS for education policy classes such as \u201cProgram Evaluation and Education Policy\u201d by Professor Thomas Kane, where I\u2019d be able to study the best way to approach education from a policymaker\u2019s perspective. To round out my interdisciplinary journey throughout the greater Cambridge/Boston area, I\u2019d take full advantage of the opportunities Harvard offers for cross-registering in Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses at MIT.\nIn my junior year, I\u2019d utilize my combined knowledge of education policy and AI to create a social impact ed-tech startup that improves classroom instruction by harnessing new AI capabilities to provide personalized learning to students in real time. At this point, I\u2019d also begin meeting with possible thesis advisors and applying to the Junior Deferral Program for Harvard Law School as a commitment to spending a few years in the workforce before gaining early admission to law school.\nDuring the summer before my senior year, I\u2019ll be conducting fieldwork for my senior thesis on whether a quantitative (grades and rankings-driven) approach is improving or impairing the quality of American education. I\u2019d apply to be elected either a Class Marshall or Officer to plan future class activities in the same way that I led my high school senior class and am in charge of our ten-year reunion.\nEven though it\u2019ll be a very tight squeeze time-wise, all these foci are feasible within three years from sophomore to senior year - if I start now."

Only days prior, I was biking under the radiant Chilean sun with my best friend, Nachito; now, I was racing to enter the taxi that would shield me from the unforgiving Wisconsin winter. I sprinted inside and slammed the door behind me with all the strength my body could muster. Finally protected from the biting cold, I looked back to see the airport completely covered in a fluffy white substance. \u201cNieve,\u201d my mom uttered. As the taxi started, my glossy eyes were locked on the airport until it was completely out of sight. \n\tI was in a new hemisphere, a new season, and a new life. My childlike amazement marveled at everything from the flashing walk signs to the fancy garbage trucks with mechanical arms. I quickly learned that most \u201cgringos\u201d only spoke \u201cingliish.\u201d Determined to master this new language, I immersed myself in it for months. After weeks of watching Super Why on PBS, my \u201cingliish\u201d became English. After a few months of school, I found myself comfortably giving a taxi the directions to the food bank. Within a year, at the tender age of 7, I began translating legal documents for my mom. At this young age, I felt my innocence slip through my fingers like fine sand, replaced by the heavy burden of responsibility. \nWhile my family never reached any level of affluence, the trips to the food bank stopped by the time I was 14 years old. However, the food bank never left me. I had seen poverty firsthand, felt it, tasted it. And what I knew is that I never wanted that to be my station in life. Like my parents, I sought a better life for myself, and we all knew that the only way to accomplish that was through an education that my family could not afford.\nDetermined to bridge the gap between myself and the financial void, I knew it was time for me to seek employment. I couldn\u2019t think of a more perfect place to work than Culver\u2019s. The first time I ate Culver\u2019s, my family and I walked 2 miles to indulge in their food as our special treat. It seemed appropriate that the very place that served as our refuge from poverty would then pave the financial path toward my success.\nWhat I could not have anticipated were all of the character-changing ways that Culver\u2019s would impact me. From my first day as a Team Member to my time now as a Crew Chief, while the money landed in my college fund, the challenges I faced along the way developed my resilience, leadership, and work ethic. My desserts screens screamed at me for being 20 minutes behind; I saw the panic in my understaffed kitchen\u2019s eyes when dozens of orders appeared; My heart pounded when I evacuated the building due to a gas leak. Overcoming these experiences, among dozens of others, taught me skills I will carry for the rest of my life.\nLike hands on clay, my experiences molded me. I accepted responsibility early on and learned how to ambitiously work toward my goals. Working for things that others take for granted is something that immigrants know all too well. Rather than wallow in self-pity for the hand life dealt me, I feel grateful for my hardships, as they have molded the qualities that inspire me to succeed.\n\tFrom Chile to Wisconsin, \u201cingliish\u201d to English, and Team Member to Crew Chief, my resilience, passion for learning, and motivation have guided my growth. The difficulties I faced helped me grow from a timid boy in a new nation to a confident leader. Now, I\u2019m no longer stuck peering back at the airport, but rather looking confidently into the future, eager for what's to come."

                "content": "Nothing drains the hope from the very core of my soul as much as scrutinizing the joys of Utah politics. I grew up in a state bombarded by the never-ending narrative of the broken nature of the political system meant to represent my fellow citizens and me. Party supermajorities seemingly dominate most governmental branches available. Utah districting ensures huge advantages to particular political parties, and elected officials appear to cling to office for a decade or longer no matter how egregious their actions are. However, I have a penchant for taking on seemingly impossible tasks and have also suffered from a begrudging but stubborn infatuation with politics since middle school when I became as addicted to CNN as I was to cartoons. So, partly due to a whim but primarily due to a budding desire to involve myself in the political sphere, I took on an internship under Utah House politician [NAME], who would be running for an at-large seat on the [CITY COUNCIL] during the [DATE] midterms. \nMy first assignment was to help run a campaign kick-off fundraiser attended by celebrities of [STATE] politics, including former and current mayors, [STATE] House and Senate members, and even previous federal politicians. After I spent the night starry-eyed, rushing to meet politician after politician until my feet swelled in my too-small dress shoes, I thought that I had already experienced what would be the best moment of my internship days after it began. Though I was right that it would be a moment I\u2019ll always cherish, I was wrong to believe it would be the pinnacle of my internship experience. \nAs the summer months rolled in, the bustle of the campaign truly ignited, and the hard work began. While completing what most people would view as the most mundane tasks, I discovered the extraordinary aspect of politics: the utter humanity undergirding every part of the campaign process. As part of a small, grassroots campaign, I spent almost all my time face-to-face with citizens across the county, granting me the privilege of hearing from people with wildly different opinions. As I handed out literature and signs at parks, I engaged in conversations about people\u2019s takes on what it truly means to be a Democrat in [STATE] or about what we must do to increase political activism throughout the state. As I knocked on door after door in neighborhoods countywide until my knuckles bruised while canvassing, I was met with takes on governance and cost of living radically different from my own but deeply interesting all the same. As I pored over spreadsheets to reach out to campaign donors, I noted the vast variety of people who chose to support our campaign. These interactions exposed me head-on to the people behind every election and statistic that finds its way into the news. They gave me a renewed sense of purpose as I was reminded daily of the infinitely large impact politics had the potential to exert on my community, something I simply had not been able to conceptualize before my hands-on experience. Above all, it reminded me why accepting diverse opinions and reconciling differences is necessary, something I had forgotten the importance of.  \nMy time in debate encouraged me to value contradictory beliefs early on. I reveled in spending hours getting intellectually destroyed by other students across the country all with the chance to learn from other debaters\u2019 unique understandings of issues and examine my own in relation to this diversity of thought within the world of debate. Yet, I had struggled to apply that to the real world and suffered from a lack of willingness to budge on my political views after growing up in a world defined by hyperpolarization and a general refusal to cede any ground on divisive societal issues. That is why my internship represents a fundamental shift in how I view the world. As I have increasingly encountered people deeply affected by politics, I recognize the necessity to push for dialogue that will result in action. Those same people, the ones who were willing to have long talks on their porches about issues on their minds and the ones who offered cool water bottles when I was canvassing in [STATE]\u2019s suffocating summer heat, would be the ones who suffered if political dialogues failed to materialize into tangible action. So, I learned to embrace difference rather than balk at it, transforming my methods to make change from ones that would align with my interests to ones that acknowledged other perspectives I would be completely blind to otherwise. \nFrom now on, I\u2019ve made a vow to strive for the uncomfortable and the challenging. Living in a state where my views represent the minority is something I now see as a gift. Every conversation is an opportunity to learn something new because no one thinks the same way I do, and that is a wonderful, not undesirable aspect of humanity. So, I won\u2019t be the next victim of the ideological dogmatism that has dehumanized modern politics. People who seek to change the world through actions informed only by their own perspectives will always fall short because their actions will serve themselves rather than the people impacted by those initiatives."

Eb7\u2026 and I began. \nTo say that music is a big part of my life would be an understatement; calm lo-fi music fuels my concentration while indulging in the worlds of chemistry, physics, and quantum mechanics, just as heavy rock motivates me before crucial tournament soccer games. But by far, my saxophone is the most substantial connection I have with music. It is my voice, my muse, my everything. \nThe notes are my words; when put together, they make coherent phrases that can tell stories, describe my mood, or vent my frustrations. As a less sociable person, my saxophone is the easiest way to express myself. While I might struggle to talk to a group of people or stumble over my words when trying to explain something, when I\u2019m on stage and free to play anything, I\u2019m the most confident and fearless man alive. Being a musician not only gives me a passage to the outside world, it also allows me to improve my skill set. \nI honed several skills from my playing, including leadership and responsibility. As the first chair for three years of my high school jazz career, I had to guide my section through every song, choosing the inflections and articulations for every phrase. As a senior, I have now taken the role of the student director, giving me responsibilities of distributing music, conducting rehearsals when our band director is absent, and coordinating our concerts and swing night. Besides my important leadership roles within music, I also developed my time management skills. Having to balance academics, soccer, taking care of my mother, 30+ hours of work a week, and still practice two hours a day has been a stretch at times; but it forced me to become more organized, developing plans and schedules for everything, which has carried over into my academics and work. Saxophone has been stressful at times, even with this added organization, but there\u2019s one person who, no matter what, I will continue to practice and improve for; my mother. \nI began learning saxophone shortly after she was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor. Her surgeries and treatments have taken her speech and writing skills, but my instrument has always been a steady line of communication between us. She has never missed a concert and has seen me progress from a squeaky, unconfident 4th grader to a bold, assured 12th-grade lead alto who jumps at the opportunity to take improvisational solos. From late-night serenades after soccer practice and homework to my recent attempts at learning trumpet and piano, she is always eager to hear me play, and it is the easiest way for us to be present in one another\u2019s lives despite the difficulty of her condition. \nThe chords reset to the A-section. I take off, flying between flat 7s, 5ths, and 3rds while using grace notes to transition from chord to chord. Everything besides me and my instrument is frozen. The world is mine. Although it is just a 30-second snippet of improvisation, within it is the nine years I have dedicated to bettering my musical ability and my life story told not through words but through the unspoken communication of notes and melodies."

In \u201cTian Guan Ci Fu\u201d (\u201cTGCF\u201d, or \u201cHeaven Official\u2019s Blessing\u201d in English), this Water-Cup-Conundrum was answered. A State Preceptor once presented his Prince with the conundrum:\n\u201cIf 2 men were walking in the desert about to die from thirst and you only had 1 cup of water to offer, which man would you give the cup to?\u201d \nThe Prince answered: \u201cBoth.\u201d\nThe State Preceptor was perplexed: \u201cThere\u2019s only 1 cup of water.\u201d \n\u201cThen I\u2019d create a cup,\u201d the Prince declared. \u201cI\u2019d ascend to the heavens, become a God, and create a cup.\u201d \nThough the State Preceptor called him insane, the Prince stood firm. And I stand with the Prince, because I believe our world is positive-sum, where water cups can be created, and not zero-sum, where we\u2019re forced to choose whose cup to fill.\nAll my life, I\u2019ve acted as a bridge between parents, juggling the seemingly impossible task of trying to fill both cups when they\u2019d demand I pick a side and fill only one cup. Consequently, I\u2019ve been able to steer them away from divorce and towards a closer relationship than ever before, 30 years into marriage. Had I chosen just one side, my family wouldn\u2019t still be whole.\nThis \u201cfill-both-cups\u201d philosophy has extended to my professional life. I\u2019m an advocate for increasing the International Affairs budget and allocating more funding towards fighting extreme poverty. As a Political Ambassador for [ORGANIZATION NAME], a nonprofit dedicated to fighting extreme poverty, I have been lobbying Congress to increase foreign aid and help those in dire need. In January, I met with Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s office to request an increase in foreign aid. From my research, Texas\u2019s biggest trade partner is Mexico, and U.S. foreign aid has doubled trade with Mexico. National foreign aid has reaped economic benefits for Texas, meaning allocating more funds towards the International Affairs budget is a win-win policy, benefitting the state of Texas.\nThough some, like the State Preceptor in \u201cTGCF\u201d, believe it to be impossible to create more abundance for all, evidence proves them wrong. In the book, the Prince ascends to Godhood and does the previously unthinkable - he descends to the mortal world to end wars and create peace, proving the impossible possible. Most importantly, the Prince represents the existence of win-win situations where abundance can be created and both cups can be filled.\nWholeheartedly, I believe that allocating funds to benefit other countries, especially to fight extreme poverty, is an example of creating another cup. Small investments to help the poor in foreign countries create large returns on investment for America. The world\u2019s fastest growing economies often buy U.S. goods and expand American economic prosperity. Just like the Prince bet on himself to fill both cups and turned out to ultimately achieve the impossible, disregarding the Preceptor\u2019s disbelief, I will continue to fill both cups - creating abundance where there is none."

Where there was once a towering tree with strong branches, now there is only the jagged edges of an axe to wood. An axe I never had control over, an axe of loss, choice, and circumstance. At six, as I sat pondering what color to use for the trunk of my family tree, I lamented its barren-nature. Fruitful branches higher up on the tree, cleanly sliced from the trunk, leaving no sign of their presence, but for a small scab of bark. These branches were victims of family that came before me, that following a family quarrel, took the liberty of wildly swinging the axe at the tree, taking with them wise grandparents, boisterous cousins, and giddy aunts that I\u2019ll never meet. I chose yellow. Optimistically, I thought of it as \u201ctrimming\u201d, better to have a healthy tree, than one riddled with brittle branches.  The following year, the axe swung again. This time I left my crayons in their box. My father\u2019s branch had been severed too soon, and with its loss, the others around it withered, leaving my tree lopsided. My father\u2019s side barren, and my mother\u2019s scarce. After the age of seven, I lost the little love I had left for drawing family trees. As other kids decoupaged colorful leaves and attached gold-toned pictures to crayon-drawn Giant Sequoias, I was left with a stump, unable to place members on its branches, or know the depths of its roots. \nFor a while, I resigned myself to an incomplete family tree; yet, I couldn\u2019t forget my yellow trunk, colored by an optimistic six year old, so at fifteen, my relentless curiosity gave way and I began my journey to explore my roots. With a quick swab, and a month of patience, I soon had my ancestry results.\nI have held on to these results for two years, in hopes of one day doing what all teens in American coming of age movies seek to do- embark on a journey of self-discovery. These movies emphasize explorative journeys of self-discovery where rebellious teens break free from their familial chains to discover their own path. In contrast to these stories, I believe my journey of self-discovery begins in the very connections these characters are adamant on breaking. I seek self-discovery in its purest form, as a way to first understand myself and my origins, before seeking to grow beyond them. If I took a gap year, my explorative journey would begin in [COUNTRY], a beautiful seaside town where my ancestors once lived. Perhaps they were dock workers with weathered hands, and salt-sprayed overalls, who labored under the beating sun, and had a penchant for [CITY]-grown tobacco, or maybe they were traditional fado singers, cozied into dark cafes and pubs, singing their melancholic song as they strummed their guitars with worn fingers. Next, I would visit the [CONTINENT]. I\u2019ve never been much of a hiker, but my ancestors must have been, to navigate the high peaks and plateaus of the mountains. Perhaps they were ceramicists, with clay always caught beneath their nails and their hands stained three different colors from their mineral paint. Their houses beautifully decorated with their ceramics, depicting folk tales and family history.  Perhaps they were teachers of the [LANGUAGE], seeking to preserve it from the threat of globalization, carefully reciting [NON-ENGLISH SENTENCE], \u201cHello, How are you?\u201d to eager students. They represent the rich cultural history of the [ETHNICITY], dedicated to preserving their history through breath-taking art and language. After, I would visit [COUNTRY], staying in [CITY] in hopes of watching their most popular sport, [SPORT]. Perhaps my ancestors in [COUNTRY] were of an older time, where [SPORT] was not for sport, but part of the preparation for battle, or perhaps they are still around as wrestlers seeking [NON-ENGLISH WORD], or \u201chonor\u201d. This evolution is a reminder to remain connected to tradition, celebrating it with others.  Lastly, I would visit [COUNTRY], taking a train across the [COUNTRY] countryside, breathing in the crisp Autumn air and witnessing the changing foliage. Perhaps my ancestors once did the same, cozying up in their seats with a worn copy of Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d, as stone houses flitted past their windows on their way to [RESTAURANT NAME] for the best bowl of [ETHNICITY] Stew. A reminder to appreciate life as it happens, taking in beautiful scenery and inspiring literature.\nMy gap year would allow me to fill in the \u201cgap\u201d in my ancestry. Although the plan for my gap year began with the intention of adding new branches to my tree and learning the depths of my roots, so that I too could color in a family tree, along the way, I realized that maybe I would never have a Giant Sequoia, but I could have a quilt. My family quilt would be made up of all the experiences of those who came before me, my dockworkers, ceramicists, wrestlers, and bookworms, each of their stories colorful patches of my quilt. Knowing my ancestry is an assurance that I am not the sapling I once thought I was, with no roots to hold her down in the face of a storm, rather, I am capable of paving my own path, supported by the comforting presence of my family quilt draped over my shoulders. Though this trip wouldn\u2019t mark the conclusion of my journey of self-discovery, it would be the embarkment of something great. My journey is sure to be fruitful, teaching me that when difficulties arise, I will be able to turn to my family quilt, tracing the stitching between patches, and take comfort in the resilience and passion of those that came before me."

                "content": "\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d When asked by one of the schoolchildren to dance in their cardboard schoolhouse located in a small village on the tip of [COUNTRY], my \u201cJust Dance\u201d video game skills simply did not prove sufficient compared to the pure joy in their little hearts that seemed to drive each dance step they took to the soulful beat. Upon arriving, I wasn\u2019t expecting much from the homes held together by scraps of metal, repurposed wire, and cardboard boxes, but when I entered their makeshift school building, I stepped into a whole new world: [NAME] music, scents of spices to which my nose was unaccustomed, and children running around in clothes of colors so unique that I couldn\u2019t even give them a name. When the teacher says \u201c[WORD]\u201d in [LANGUAGE], silence falls over the children like a blanket, and they stare at me in awe. This lasts only for a split second before they run up to me, unable to contain their excitement. \u201cWe have been practicing our English,\u201d a little boy says to me amongst the chaos. \u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d \n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d I reply. We gather in a circle and the beat of the drum echoes off the cardboard walls. I awkwardly try to dance to the rhythm and keep up with the children\u2019s moves. I feel a small hand grasp mine, and I look down to see a little girl trying to sway me to the beat. \u201cLoosen up,\u201d she says as the other children erupt in laughter, instantly humbling my dance skills. Simply being around these children and their families allowed me to see the world through a different lens. There was no argument that could be made against the genuine happiness and sense of community that was present in that village. During my visit, one question seemed to ring louder than the rest: how could they be so happy with so little and how could people back home be so discontent with so much? These people were living under a roof made of scraps, yet the connection I felt with them was far more genuine than any association money could buy. These memories were so meaningful to me that they continued to linger in my mind even after I returned home. \nSitting in class, the same items that those [ETHNICITY] families were using as supplies to build their houses, were being thrown in the trash can without a second thought or a recycling bin in sight. On a microcosmic level, the lack of recycling resourcefulness in my school building echoed the macrocosmic lack of bigger-picture perspective in my community. Looking for a way to alter the pattern of waste at my school and around the city, I joined the sustainability club, and we began to take action right away. We initially implemented a school-wide recycling program by placing a blue bin in each classroom, collecting them weekly, and taking the contents to the local recycling center. I realized the impact this could have not only on our school, but also on the community.  With the average school using 320,000 sheets of paper per year, our program has saved trees, reduced waste, and helped preserve the environment. With my hopes of every school in Reno following this model, 3,702 trees will be saved annually.\nWhen I was younger, these numbers wouldn\u2019t have even seemed possible to me, particularly as a fourth-grader. In fourth grade, I held the position of superintendent of grounds (even though I\u2019m pretty sure I couldn\u2019t even spell superintendent at that time of my life). As such, I developed a weekly schedule to pick up litter around the school and recycle it. To make a small impact took a big effort back then, so to see my small efforts at my school ripple around the community and make a big impact in Reno was quite a pleasant surprise! The accomplishments of my 9-year-old self may seem minuscule, but they connect me to my deeper roots of preserving the environment and have continued to feed my deepest-seated beliefs in sustainability along the way. Programs like the Harvard College Environmental Action Committee would allow these roots to continue to flourish and grow, guiding me on my path to plant the seeds of sustainability worldwide. Paradoxically, big change can stem from the smallest adjustment in how we view the things we consider ordinary, so the next time you go to throw away a piece of cardboard, first imagine what kind of home you could build with it."

He died alone due to Covid restrictions. He and my grandmother had flown from [STATE] to [CITY] so that my grandmother could have a hip replacement at [HOSPITAL NAME]. He contracted Covid while in [CITY]  and, in a tragic twist of events, he ended up dying in that very same hospital. When a loved one passes away, they are torn away from us, leaving a tear in our lives where they once were. In Judaism, we tear our clothes in mourning to symbolize our pain and sorrow. Sadly, the tears in our family fabric happened long before my grandfather died from Covid.\nSpecifically, my father married a gentile. Typically, in the Jewish religion, it is expected that one marry another Jew: \"You shall not marry them (the gentiles, about which the Torah speaks in the previous verses), you shall not give your daughter to their son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son.\" The reason for this prohibition is clearly spelled out in the following verse: \"because he will lead your son astray from Me and they will serve strange gods\u2026\"\nMy father was raised in a reform Jewish family. They were not very observant but, culturally, their Jewish identity was meaningful. It was important to his family that he become a bar mitzvah when he turned 13. The portrait of him reading from the Torah on the bima has always been proudly displayed in my grandparents\u2019 home. I even used his yad (Torah pointer) and kiddush cup when I became a bar mitzvah. I think that my grandmother, however, wasn\u2019t thrilled that my father fell in love with a non-Jew. \nJudaism is matrilineal, meaning one born to a Jewish mother is Jewish. My mother chose to convert from Catholicism to Judaism in her first year of marriage. She wanted her future family to be of one faith and, learning about the religion through my father, she eagerly converted to Judaism and embraced the customs and traditions. So my brother, my sister, and I are all Jewish through birth: matrilineally. \nOver the course of my parents\u2019 happy 25 years of marriage, my grandmother has never warmed up to my mother; if anything, she became overtly hostile. Because of her disdain, my immediate family has been ostracized. While I was growing up, my parents tried to please her, but it was always tense at birthdays, holidays, recitals, and the like. We were left out of most family get-togethers. Even while at my grandparents\u2019 home cheering for our beloved [FOOTBALL TEAM NAME], it seemed my family was on a separate team. My grandmother treated my mother like an outsider and, by default, me.\nOne person who never made my mother or any member of my family feel left out, however, was my grandfather. He did his best to knit the family together. He was a kind, intelligent, hard-working role model who I\u2019ve always strived to emulate. He had a long career as a [PHYSICIAN] in [STATE], loved attending my piano recitals so much that he began piano lessons at the age of 80, and even sparked my love of fishing when I was five and he took me to a small pond near his home. He rarely missed one of my tennis matches and was supportive when I lost. Education was crucial to him, so he encouraged me to study and get good grades. \nMy grandfather greatly enjoyed his time spent with us. One of my fondest memories is climbing into my grandfather\u2019s old, wooden, black-and-gold chair. He told me it was his Harvard chair. On my father\u2019s 40th birthday, my grandfather proudly presented my father with his own Harvard chair. He told me that if I worked really hard in school, someday I might get a shot at attending Harvard and becoming a third-generation alumni to continue their legacy. He said maybe someday I\u2019d be the caretaker of all three chairs. I didn\u2019t really know what Harvard was at that time, but I knew that no matter what happened, I was determined to make my grandfather and my father proud. I did what my grandfather said: I studied hard and got great grades, I trained hard and played great tennis, and I practiced hard and played great piano. As I write this, I am sitting in my father\u2019s Harvard chair. \nBecause of the rift in my family, I rarely saw my grandfather the last two years of his life. My parents threw him a party for his 80th birthday, which he loved because he was at the beach surrounded by all of his children and grandchildren. My parents invited them for birthdays, recitals, and Mother's Day, but my grandmother always said \u201cno\u201d. Looking back, I bet he would\u2019ve loved to attend each event. After all, he moved to [CITY] to be with family. He would\u2019ve loved that I\u2019m applying to Harvard now, as it was always something he wished for me and of which he knew I was capable. I wonder what his application process was like back in the 1950s\u2026 \nNow, my grandfather is gone, and I have to wonder if all of the heartache was worth it. What did my grandmother gain by not welcoming my mother into the family? Her intolerance cheated us of time with my grandfather that we will never get back. But thanks to him, my background is as diverse as it comes. I\u2019m a direct descendent of [SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS] who were involved in the Salem Witch Trials. I have a great, great grandmother from [COUNTRY] and great grandparents from [COUNTRY]. Diversity adds to families. Just as my father introduced her to Judaism, my mother brought gifts from her side, like excellent cooking, art, music, and height. Ultimately, I\u2019m so glad that my parents found each other because, together, they made me."
