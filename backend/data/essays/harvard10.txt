As a [ETHNICITY] athlete in a sport designed by and for white people, I never fit in, but probably not for the reason why you’d imagine. In addition to ethnicity, I was a pathetic ski racer. In terms of skill, I belonged anywhere but the mountain.  
But I had tenacity in spades, so I refused to budge, working to exhaustion resulting in until my peers elected me [HIGH SCHOOL] team captain, and in my. I leading a team with US ski team members and relatives of Olympians. This wasn’t magical improvement, but because I realized that belonging is showing up and working harder than my teammates even if I finish behind them. 
I recently left [HIGH SCHOOL] to prioritize passions like debate. However, I’ll apply values from [HIGH SCHOOL] at Harvard and beyond. Despite never fitting the typical image of a ski racer, I execute my own vision of leading my peers, no matter how out of place I appear.
