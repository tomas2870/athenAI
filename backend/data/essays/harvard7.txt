The grand piano beckons me as I climb the stage to perform. Trained fingers avidly seek the first keys. My heart beats staccato, my breath syncopates with excitement. No time to stall, I attack the first note. 
I am a pianist. Age five was my first lesson, and I’ve logged thousands of hours since. Practice is automatic, like brushing my teeth. It all started with Hot Cross Buns, now I’m playing Chopin. My study has included theory, technique, composition, musicality, performance, and history. I have learned to best adversity like  stage fright, criticism, tight deadlines, boredom, procrastination, and doubt. Mastery is always just out of reach but nonetheless well worth pursuing. 
The skills I have acquired learning piano have assisted me in tennis, relationships, and school. Piano for me is a metaphor for what it takes to succeed in life: hard work, persistence, and courage.
