Instead of lacing my cleats for the big game, I buckle my fanny pack and throw on my sports medicine polo. As the game begins, I’m instantly immersed in the football conversations. Most slip by until I hear something familiar, perhaps the most infamous phrase surrounding athletic injuries: “Don’t tell Coach.”
As a medical assistant who works high school games treating injuries, hearing this was more concerning than it would normally sound to me as a teammate. After telling a player to sit out, he asks if I’d heed my own advice in my own sport, so I pitch it from an athlete’s perspective. “Imagine being unable to make the game-winning catch in next week’s championship because you wanted to score one more touchdown tonight.” He removes his helmet, allowing me to start concussion protocol, and looks at me like I spoke some mythical language no medical assistant could know.
