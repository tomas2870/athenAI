Growing up, I wanted to be better than everybody else in everything I did. As a ninth-grader, I was proud to have made Varsity Squash. But it hit me when I realized I wasn’t the very best. I was toward our roster’s bottom rank, meaning that my tournament matches didn’t count toward our team’s overall point value. Yet, my teammates still rooted for me like I was representing the national team at the World Squash Championships and encouraged me to apply my focus while staying relaxed during every point. As I’ve improved, I’ve taken that lesson to heart and applied it back to my teammates, emphasizing that our personal wins and losses are our entire team’s wins and losses. Now, as I watch [NAME] battle his way through a tie-break, or observe [NAME] swift backhand, I enjoy being behind the glass  - hooting and cheering - for the team.
